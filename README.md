# Basics

This UI-only project takes in a JSON tree object and displays an Org Chart

## To Run

To run this app please type the command `yarn start` or any other command that will run react on localhost:3000

## After Action Report

It was good jumping back into react hooks and creating custom hooks, The JSON implementation on my end was pretty rough
In the future I would go forward with a Better React to library model.

## Final Thoughts

While I was able to successfully create a Org chart I was unable to add connection lines to provide better
UX for individuals. Overall, I was happy with some of the modifications I made such as a custom Context Menu,
as well as some fun React Component Recursion.
